<h1>Python Port Scanner</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This project consists of creating a port scanner using the coding language Python. This incorporates Nmap to get the data that's needed. Port scanners can be used by both the blue team and the red team. Blue team can use port scanners to see if there's a vulnerable port that needs to be fixed. The red team can use port scanners to see if there's a vulnerable port that can be exploited to access a system. I will be running the port scanner on my Kali Linux virtual machine, but you can run it on any system with Python installed.

<h2>Environments Used:</h2>

  - Python
  
  - Kali Linux
    
<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

1. Start Kali Linux machine.
   Walkthrough on how to set up a Kali Linux virtual machine: [Kali Linux Virtual Machine](https://github.com/ntieu4328/Virtual-Box-Kali-Linux)
   
2. Download the PortScanner.py file on the Kali Linux virtual machine
  
3. Run these commands before running the program:

```bash
sudo apt-install python3-pip
pip install python-nmap
```

4. Run the program and input the information that's requested.

<b>Project finished!!!</b>
